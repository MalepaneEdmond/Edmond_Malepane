<h1 align="center"> Hi, I'm Edmond! 👋 </h1>

<h3> 🧔 &nbsp; About Me 👇 </h3>

<p><em>I am an MSc student exploring the <strong>"Limitations of Conversational Agents for Statistical Analysis"</strong> at <a href="https://www.aims.ac.za/">AIMS South Africa</a>, affiliated with the <a href="https://www.uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town</a></em> 📚

My passion for statistics is matched with a strong foundation in probability theory, time series analysis, generalized linear models, and multivariate analyses, all underpinned by rigorous training in R Studio. I'm particularly proud of my honours project, "Variable Selection in Multiple Linear Regression: An application to the determinants of life expectancy," which showcased my data analytical abilities.
